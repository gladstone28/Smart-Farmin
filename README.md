What is Smart Farming in 5 bullet points?

**ANSWER**

Smart farming, a key aspect of precision agriculture, leverages technology to increase the quantity and quality of agricultural products. Here are five key points about it:

- Use of IoT Devices and Sensors: Smart farming employs Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors to monitor crop fields, measuring variables like temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil nutrients, enabling precise agricultural practices.

- Data Analytics and AI: It utilizes data analytics and artificial intelligence to process data collected from the field, providing insights for making informed decisions on planting, watering, and harvesting crops more efficiently.

- Automation and Robotics: Incorporates automation and robotics for tasks such as planting, watering, and harvesting, reducing labor costs and improving efficiency and precision.

- Remote Monitoring and Management: Enables farmers to monitor and manage their crops remotely using smartphones or computers, improving convenience and accessibility.

- Sustainable Practices: Promotes sustainability by optimizing resource use, reducing waste, and minimizing the environmental impact of farming practices, leading to more sustainable agricultural outputs.
